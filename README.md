# NetworkEvaluation
 Integrated Network Protocols Evaluation Framework


1. Simulation of Distance Vector Routing Algorithm for the following Network Topologies, specifically the Bellman-Ford algorithm, is used to calculate the optimal paths, Routing Table for each node, Convergence Time and Routing Overhead. 

The following network topologies are used: 

    1. Fully-Connected Topology
    2. Ring Topology
    3. Star Topology 
    4. Binary Tree Topology
    5. Bus Topology 
    6. Square Grid Topology 
    7. Variable Grid Topology 

2. Network Analysis on different Network Topologies with a variable number of nodes. 

The following metrics are calculated for each Network Topology : 

    1. Degree Centrality: Number of connections each node has.
    2. Shortest Paths: To Calculate the shortest path between all pairs of nodes.
    3. Betweenness Centrality: Quantifies the weightage of a node in connecting to other nodes.
    4. Network Diameter: Determines the maximum shortest path length in the network.
    5. Closeness Centrality: Measures closeness of a node to all other nodes in the network.
    6. Modularity: Evaluates division of nodes into distinct groups.
    7. Network Resilience: Measures network's robustness to node removal.
    8. Visualization
    
    
3. Simulation of ALOHA MAC Protocol 
    1. Calculate Throuugput and Average Delay 
    2. Simmulates Packet Transmission using nnumber of packets, load, fixed tranmission time, start and end of service and arraival time. 

4. Spanning Tree Protocol Simulation 
    Calculate Spanning tree for network of different and random topologies
