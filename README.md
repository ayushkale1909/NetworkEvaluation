# NetworkEvaluation
 Integrated Network Protocols Evaluation Framework


## 1. Simulation of Distance Vector Routing Algorithm for the following Network Topologies, specifically the Bellman-Ford algorithm, is used to calculate the optimal paths, Routing Table for Each Node, Convergence Time and Routing Overhead. 

The following network topologies are used: 

    1. Fully-Connected Topology
    2. Ring Topology
    3. Star Topology 
    4. Binary Tree Topology
    5. Bus Topology 
    6. Square Grid Topology 
    7. Variable Grid Topology 

## 2. Network Analysis on different Network Topologies with a variable number of nodes. 

The following metrics are calculated for each Network Topology : 

    1. Degree Centrality: Number of connections each node has.
    2. Shortest Paths: To Calculate the shortest path between all pairs of nodes.
    3. Betweenness Centrality: Quantifies the weightage of a node in connecting to other nodes.
    4. Network Diameter: Determines the maximum shortest path length in the network.
    5. Closeness Centrality: Measures closeness of a node to all other nodes in the network.
    6. Modularity: Evaluates division of nodes into distinct groups.
    7. Network Resilience: Measures network's robustness to node removal.
    8. Visualization
